Hi! My name is Jaadyn Humphries and online I go by the handle Ryushe.  
When it comes down to it, I am really interested in offensive security. Right now I participate in CTF's and coding in languages such as Python and Rust trying to improve my offensive game.  

# About this blog
I am primarily creating this blog to document my learnings. My hope for this blog is to not only understand what I did and why I did things a little better, but be able to help someone else in the process. (I also had no prior experience with ruby/big website projects so this helped push me out of my comfort zone a little.)
