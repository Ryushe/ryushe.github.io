Hi! My name is Jaadyn Humphries and online I go by the handle Ryushe. I am a 20 year old individual, with 2 years of hands on experience in offensive security. 
Currently, I participate in bug bounty sites, HackTheBox/TryHackMe challenges and code in Python, Bash, and JavaScript.

My expertise:
- Web application hacking
- Python 
- Bash
- Javascript

If you would like to see my full skill list check out my github [here](https://github.com/ryushe). 



# Why a blog?
I am primarily creating this blog to document my learnings. My hope for this
blog is to not only understand what I did and why I did things a little better,
but be able to help someone else in the process. (I also had no prior experience
with ruby/big website projects so this helped push me out of my comfort zone a
little.)

# Certifications
* CompTIA Security+ 
* Flatiron School Cybersecurity Engineering Certificate
* TryHackMe Offensive Pentesting Certification
