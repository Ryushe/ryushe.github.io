Hi there, my name is Jaadyn Humphries. If you haven't seen the about page I am a
recent Flatiron graduate and am looking to become a pen-tester. This little blog
site that I have created using Jekyll & Minimal Mistakes is a way for me to
share my learning progress and have something to look back on in the future.  
I hope you enjoy your time here on this site and are able to get a lot from it.
