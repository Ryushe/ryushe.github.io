Not gonna lie, its been a while since I posted... Now what have I been up to. Well, learning XSS, COLMAK and much more. I recently started trying to work on bounties as well. I am going through hacker one and so far I am loving it! 


So, what is this post for. Well to my future employers, I would like to show what I have learned and that I am doing things :sob: 

What I have learned since the post two months ago:

* Proper web recon for bounties
* XSS -> hoisting lab found [here](https://brutelogic.com.br/blog/xss-with-hoisting/)
* Colmak keyboard layout

This may not sound like a lot but at the moment I'm kinda sick ðŸ¥² so, I am trying my best to still learn. 

Out of all of this I found it facinating that JS is willing to pull the fn up to the top even if it isn't declared before it is called. Meaning you can create/replace functions with xss and have them do completely new things. HEHEHE


Thank you to my future employer for reading this and goodbye for now! ðŸ˜ˆ
