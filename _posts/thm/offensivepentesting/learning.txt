There are two types of access tokens:
    Primary access tokens: those associated with a user account that are generated on log on
    Impersonation tokens: these allow a particular process(or thread in a process) to gain access to resources using the token of another (user/client) process
For an impersonation token, there are different levels:
    SecurityAnonymous: current user/client cannot impersonate another user/client
    SecurityIdentification: current user/client can get the identity and privileges of a client but cannot impersonate the client
    SecurityImpersonation: current user/client can impersonate the client's security context on the local system
    SecurityDelegation: current user/client can impersonate the client's security context on a remote system
